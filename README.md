- Power Bank
- Motor Driver Shield
- Sonar Sensor
- LShape Motor
- Bread Board
- Chessis

**Softwares Used:**

# Training data generation

We generate training data, with the help of mentioned codes.
Working of sensors used:
- IR sensor:   Used to measure speed of wheels.
- Sonar sensor: Used to measure distance between obstace and mobile robot .
  Speed of wheels are maintained with the help of andriod app in accordance with the distance between obstacle and the mobile robot.
  The data generated by these sensors is displayed on the web page and saved in the .txt format.
  
  
# Code for node mcu

Using the train data we generate the weights and here with the help of updated weights we test the mobile robot for the obstacle 
avoidance.
