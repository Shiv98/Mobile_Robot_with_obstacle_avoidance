# Training_data_generation

We generate traning data, with mentioned codes.
Working of follownig sensors:
- IR sensor:   used to measure speed of wheels.
- Sonar sensor: used to measure distance between obstace and mobile_robot .
  Speed of wheels is maintain with the help of andriod app acoording to distance between obstacle and mobile_robot.
  The data generated by these sensors is displed on the web page and saved in the txt formate.
  
  
# Code for node mcu

Using the train data we generate the weights and here with the help of updated weights we test the mobile robot for the obstacle 
avoidance.
